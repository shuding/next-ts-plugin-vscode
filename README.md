# Always-On Next.js TypeScript Plugin

[**Install the extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shuding.next-ts-plugin-vscode)

When this VS Code extension is enabled, it will automatically use the [built-in TypeScript plugin](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#typescript-plugin) for all your Next.js projects.

Without it, you'll have to manually switch to the Workspace TypeScript version every time you open a Next.js project, due to a current VS Code limitation.
